<p>At just 18 years old, Billie Eilish has quickly become a global pop-phenom since the release of her first single “ocean eyes” in 2016. Since then, Billie has released many singles for TV shows and movies, an EP called <em>don’t smile at me</em>, and an award-winning album called <em>WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?</em>. At the 2020 Grammys, Billie won Album of The Year and Record of the Year for her first album.</p>
<p>Although very young, Billie has defied normal genre bounds and created her sound to captivate her audience, who have never heard anything like it before. She combines many different genres to produce music that can have either a dark message or a more light-hearted and sarcastic tone. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billie_Eilish">Wikipedia</a> has consolidated her music genre to be described as pop, electro-pop, and dark pop.</p>
<p>Besides her unique music, she also has breaks many social norms of what a woman in the pop-music industry is supposed to look like. Her oversized clothes, influenced by goth and skater fashion, have empowered young women to rethink the motivation behind what they wear.
Overall, Eilish has redefined what a pop-icon looks and sounds like. <strong>Below, you can sample some of the work that she co-wrote with her brother and producer, Finneas O’Connell.</strong> </p>
